|                                         **DBMS**                                         |                                          **File Processing System**                                          |

|                         Minimal data redundancy problem in DBMS.                         |                                        Data Redundancy problem exits.                                        |
|                            Data Inconsistency does not exist.                            |                                          Data Inconsistency exist.                                           |
|                              Accessing database is easier.                               |                                    Accessing is comparatively difficult.                                     |
|                The problem of data isolation is _not found_ in database.                 | Data is scattered in various files and files may be of different format, _So data isolation problem exists_. |
|     Transactions like insert, delete, view, updating, etc are possible in database.      |                                In file system, transactions are not possible.                                |
|                 Concurrent access and recovery is possible in database.                  |                            Concurrent access and _recovery is **not possible**._                             |
|                                    Security of data.                                     |                                        Security of data is not good.                                         |
| A database manager (administrator) stores the relationship in form of structural tables. |              A file manager is used to store all relationships in directories in file systems.               |
