# **Hardware** vs **Software**
| **Hardware**                                                                                                       | **Software**                                                                                           |

| **Hardware** refers to the *physical devices or components* that are ==physically connected to the computer==.           | **Software** is any **set of instructions** that tells the *hardware* ==what to do and how to do it.== |
| Hardware _cannot perform_ any task ==without software.==                                                             | The software _can not_ be ==executed without hardware.==                                               |
| Hardware typically ==wears out over time.==                                                                        | The software ==does not wear out with time.== _However_, it may contain **flaws and glitches.**        |
| There are _4 main types_ of **Hardware**:- Input Devices, Output Devices, Storage, and Internal Components.          | **Software** are divied *mainly in 2 parts*:- System Software & Application Software.                    |
| **Examples -** CPU, hard drives, monitors, keyboard, mouse, scanners, printers etc.                                | **Examples -** Google Chrome, OS, Doom Game, Discord etc.                                              |
