# **Introduction**

## **What is Software Engineering?**
- Software¬†is *more than just a program code*.
- On the other hand Engineering is all about *developing products, using well-defined, scientific principles and methods*.
- Thus, It's a *systematic collection* of good program development **practices and techniques**. (An *engineering approach* to *develop a software*.)
- From above points of view we can define Soft Eng as:
	- Soft Eng discusses *systematic & cost-effective* techniques for Software Development. It is *an engineering approach to develop software*.
## *is* **Software Engineering Art or Science?**
- Many people think writing good quality code is an Art. So let's discuss about this:
	- In other engineering branches It is based on science there are *specific rules & names for the components, techniques* & working principles related to it & before they are *standardized the experience is marked as* their **Thumb Rule** and on the basis of it, *the rules are standardized by various organizations*.
	- Likewise in Soft Eng there is *heavy use of knowledge* which comes from **experience of practitioners**, & *well organizations or resarcher's made systmeatically organzied* the experience in ***thoeritical form***.
	- Thus, like any other Engineering Disciplines, *Soft Eng is a "Science" that is **transformed from "Art"***.
