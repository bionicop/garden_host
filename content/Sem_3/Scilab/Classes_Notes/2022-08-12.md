## Scilab
- Open Source Software.
- Numerical Calulation.
- This Program runs on Matrix.

## What can we do with Scilab?
- Basic Maths
- 2-D & 3-D Visualization
- Optimization
- Statistics
- Control Systems
- Signal Processing
- Application Development


## Some Basic Notes
1. We should write down our code on the Scilab editor notes.
	- **WHY** you *ask*?
	- *well, typing directly into console has TWO disadvantages.*
		1. It is **NOT** possible to save command.
		2. It is **NOT** easy to edit multiple lines of instruction.

2. Useful workplace in Scilab consists of several windows :-
	1. The **Console** for making *Calulators*.
	2. The **Editor** for making *Programs*.
	3. The **Graphics Window** for displaying *graphics*.
	4. The **Embededded HELP.**

### Addition using two variables-

#### Description- 
- Creates a **matrix** of *zeros or ones*.

*Input-*
```scilab
//Addition using two variables
a = 69;
b = 420;
ans1 = a+b;
```

*Output-*
```scilab
 a  = 
   69.
 b  = 
   420.
 ans1  = 
   489.

  "Execution done."
```

### Subtraction using two variables-
*Input-*
```scilab
//Addition using two variables
a = 69;
b = 420;
ans1 = a+b;
```

*Output-*
```scilab
 c  = 
   69.
 d  = 
   420.
 ans2  = 
  -351.

  "Execution done."
```

### Multiplication using two variables-
*Input-*
```scilab
//Multiplication using two variables
e = 69;
f = 420;
ans3 = e * f;
```

*Output-*
```scilab
 e  = 
   69.
 f  = 
   420.
 ans3  = 
   28980.

  "Execution done."
```

### Division using two variables-
*Input-*
```scilab
//Division using two variables
g = 9;
h = 3;
ans4 = g / h;
```

*Output-*
```scilab
 ans4  = 
   3.

  "Execution done."
```

### Matrix Addition using two variables-
*Input-*
```scilab
//Matrix Addition using two variables
i = [1, 2, 3]; // "," means row.
k = [4, 5, 6];
ans5 = i + k;
```

*Output-*
```scilab
 i  = 
   1.   2.   3.
 k  = 
   4.   5.   6.
 ans5  = 
   5.   7.   9.

  "Execution done."
```

### Matrix Multiplcation using two variables-
*Input-*
```scilab
//Matrix Multiplcation using two variables
l = [1, 2, 3];
m = [4 ; 5 ; 6]; // ";" means column.
ans6 = l * m;
```

*Output-*
```scilab
 l  = 
   1.   2.   3.
 m  = 
   4.
   5.
   6.
 ans6  = 
   32.

  "Execution done."
```

### Identity & Null Matrix-

#### Description- 
- Creates a **matrix** of *zeros or ones*.

*Input-*
```scilab
//Identity & Null Matrix
x = ones(2,1);
y = zeros(4,2);
disp('The value of x is',x);
disp('The value of y is',y);
```

*Output-*
```scilab

  "The value of x is"

   1.
   1.

  "The value of y is"

   0.   0.
   0.   0.
   0.   0.
   0.   0.

  "Execution done."
```
