# **Internet Basics**

## **What is the Internet?**
- The Internet is a vast network that connects¬†[computers](computer.md) all over the world.
- Computers in a network capable of sharing resources (memory, peripherals).
- Internet is **Decentralized** by *design*.
- Each Internet computer, called a **host**, is *independent*.
- *Most users* get access to the internet through An **Internet Service Provider** (ISP). 

## **Types of Internet Connections**

### Dial-Up
- Dial-up connections require users to link their **phone line** to a *computer* in order to access the Internet.
- It does not permit users to ==make or receive phone calls== through their¬†home phone service¬†*while using the Internet*.
- Dial-up access is *cheap* **but slow.**
- It ranges from **28K*b*** to **56K*b***.

### DSL
- DSL stands for¬†**Digital Subscriber Line**.
- DSL uses existing *2-wire copper telephone line* connected to one's home so service is *delivered at the same time* as landline telephone service.
- DSL is a form of ==broadband communication== that is always **"on"**.
- Customers can *still place calls while surfing the Internet*.
- It ranges from **128K** to **8 Mbps**.

### Cable
- Cable *provides acess* to the internet through ==cable TV lines==.
- There are *different speeds* depending on if you are **uploading data transmissions** or **downloading**.
- It is a form of *broadband access cable modem* that can provide **extremely fast access** to the internet.
- It ranges from **512K** to **20 Mb/s**.

### Wireless
- The wireless connection uses a **radio frequency** band to c*onnect to the internet*.
- Wireless is also an **always "on" connection** and it can be *accessed from just about anywhere(speed may vary for different locations)*.
- It ranges from **5 Mbps** to **20 Mb/s**.

### Satellite
- Satellite accesses the internet via a satellite in Earth‚Äôs orbit.
- The *enormous distance* that a signal travels from earth to satellite and back again, provides a **delayed connection** compared to *cable and DSL*.
- It ranges from **512K** to **20 Mb/s**.
 
### Cellular
- Cellular technology *provides wireless Internet access* through **cell phones**.
- The speeds vary *depending on the provider*, but the *most common* are **3G** and **4G speeds**.
- *3G* is for *third-generation wireless* cellular network, speeds is around **2.0 Mb/s**.
- *4G* is the *fourth-generation wireless* cellular network, speeds of *100Mbps* but the reality is about **21Mbps** currently.
- It ranges from **512K** to **2.0 Mb/s**.

## **Modem**
- Modem stands for **Modulator** and **Demodulator**.
- Device that enables a computer to *transmit data over* **telephone or cable lines**.
- Converts a *computer‚Äôs digital signals* into *specific frequencies* to ==travel over telephone or cable television lines==.
- A *modem transmits data* in **Bits Per Second (bps)**.

### **Internal and External Modem**
| **Internal Modem**                                                                                                                                                                        | **External Modem**                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| As the name suggests _internal modem_ is an **internal part inside a computer**. It usually comes with the *computer pre-installed*.                                                          | An external modem is similar to the internal modem in that it also allows access to the Internet, but *unlike the internal modem*, The _external modem_ **sits outside** the computer.       |
| It can be **powered** using the ==computer's own power supply.== It takes _one_ of the **expansion slots**                                                                                          | The **modem typically connects** to the computer *via a serial or USB cable*, and is ==usually powered by an external source==, *rather then the computer*.                                      | 

### **Characteristics of Modem**

#### Speed of Transmission
- At *slow rates* modems are measured in terms of **baud rates**. 
- At *higher speeds* modems are measured in terms of **bits/sec**.

#### Modes Supported
- Support a *switch to change* between **voice** and **data modes**. 
	- Data mode ‚Äì Regular modem. 
	- Voice mode ‚Äì Regular telephone.

#### Auto-answer
- Enables to *receive your calls* in **your absence**.

#### Data Compression
- Some modems perform data compression, which enables them to send **data at faster rates**. *However*, the modem at the *receiving end must* be able to ==decompress the data using the same compression technique==.

#### Flash Memory
- *Communication protocols* can be **easily updated**.

#### Fax Capability
- *Can* **send** and **receive faxes**.

## **Standards of Data Communication**

### **CCIT**
- CCIT *stands for* **Consultative Committee for International Telephony and Telegraphy**.
- Organization that sets *International commmunication standards* example-
	- Group 3 - *Universal protocol* for **sending fax** documents ==across telephone lines==.
	- Group 4 - Over [*ISDN*](#ISDN-Connection) *network*.
	- V.21 , V.22, V.29 *etc*

### **ISDN Connection**
- ISDN *stands for* **Integrated Services Digital Network**.
- ISDN is a *telephone network based infrastructure* that allows the *transmission of* ==voice, video and data simultaneously at a high speed with greater efficiency==.
- ISDN connection has some [*B-channel*](#ISDN-Configurations) (**Bearer-channel**) which are the **main data channel** & [*D-channel*](#ISDN-Configurations) (**Delta-channel**) which ==carries control and signaling information==.

#### **ISDN Configurations**
- ##### _B or Bearer channels:_ The bearer channels are used to *carry the payload data* which may be **voice** and **data**.
- ##### _D or Delta channels:_ The D channels are *intended for signalling and control*, although it *may also be used* for *data under some circumstances*.

#### **Types of ISDN** 
- ##### Basic Rate Interface (*BRI*)
	- It is made up of 2 B-channels , at **64 Kbit/s**¬†and 1 D-channel, at **16¬†Kbit/s**.
	- **2 B-chnanel** *64-Kbits* and **1 D-channel** *16¬†Kbits*.
- ##### Primary Rate Interface (*PRI*)
	- The PRI configuration is based on *T-carrier or T1* in the **US, Canada** and **Japan** countries consisting of¬†**23 data**¬†or bearer channels and one control or delta channel, with *64kbps*.
	- The PRI configuration is based on *E-carrier or E1* in **Europe, Australia** and *few* **Asian** countries consisting of¬†**30 data**¬†or bearer channels and¬†**two-control**¬†or delta channel with *64kbps*.

### **DSL Connection**
- DSL *stands for* **Digital Subscriber Lines**.
- Similar to [*ISDN*](#ISDN-Connection) as both operate over *existing copper lines*.

#### **Types of DSL**
- #### Symmetric DSL (*SDSL*)
	- The *upload and download speeds* of an SDSL **connection are *equal***.
	- A *telephone device* **cannot be connected** to an ==SDSL line==.
	- The SDSL language was **never standardised**.
	- Supports *data rate* upto **3 Mbps**.
	- SDSL is an **expensive service.**
	- SDSL was *first provided* in **2001**.
- #### Asymmetric DSL (*ADSL*)
	- The *upload and download speeds* of an ADSL **connection are *not equal***.
	- A *telephone unit* can be **connected** to an ==ADSL line==.
	- ADSL is a **standardised technology**.
	- Supports *data transfer downstream rate* from **1.5 to 9 Mbps** and *upstream rate* from **16 to 640 Kbps**.
	- ADSL is a **low-cost option.**
	- ADSL was *initially deployed* in **1998**.

## **Baseband vs Broadband Transmission**
|                                     **Baseband**                                      |                                                       **Broadband**                                                        |
|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|             The _entire bandwidth_ is for **single signal transmission**.             | Broadband is used to describe a type of data transmission in which a _single medium_ can carry *several channels at once*. |
|        In baseband transmission, the _type of signaling_ used is **digital**.         |                            In broadband transmission, the _type of signaling_ used is *analog*.                            |
|                        A **short-distance** signal traveling.                         |           The broadband transmission can transmit over a **long distance** _compared to baseband transmission_.            |
| The baseband transmits the _digital signal_ using the ==physical medium like wires==. |   The broadband transmits the _analog signals_ using ==optical fibers and twisted cables== as a medium of transmission.    |
|                   **Example:** Ethernet is using Basebands for LAN.                   |                                    **Example:** Used to transmit cable TV to premises.                                     |
