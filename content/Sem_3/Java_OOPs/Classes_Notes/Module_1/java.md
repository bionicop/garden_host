# **What is Java?**
- It is a **high level**, **robust**, **object-oriented** and secure programing lanugage.
- Developed by Sun Micro systems in 1995. James Gosling is know as father of Java.
- Since Java has it's own JRE(Java Runtime Environment), it also acts like a platform.

# **Application of Java**
- There are mainly four types of application that can be made using Java-
	1. **Stand-alone applications** 
		- These are normal desk applicaitons, and they don't need OS to run.
		- *Example-* Media Player, Anti-Virus, *etc*.
	2. **Web Applicaitons**
		- It is a server side application which creates a dynamic webpage. 
		- *Example-* E-mail, Wikipidea, *etc*.
	3. **Enterprise Application**
		- An application distributed among enterprises.
	4. **Mobile Application**
		- An application made for mobile devices.

# **Java Features**
1. Simple
	- Java's Syntax is simple, clean and easy to understand.
	- It's Syntax is based on C++.
	- Java has removed many complicated features, like explicit pointers.
2. Automatic Garbage Collector
	- A programmer usually neglects the destination of uselss objects. These objects then take up unnecessary memory in the [`*Heap*`](#Heap), making the available memory insufficient.
	- Hence, the garbage collector in Java scans the [`*Heap*`](#Heap) memory, and deletes them, thus clearing up space in the [`*Heap*`](#Heap).
3. Object-Oriented
	- 
2. Automatic Garbage Collector
	- 

###### Heap
- Heap is a portion of memory allocated for the program to run.
